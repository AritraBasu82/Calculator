# 📱 My First Calculator Project

Hello! This is a simple calculator web page I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I made this to practice the basics of web development and learn how to handle button clicks and math logic in JS.

## 🛠️ How I Built It

* **HTML:** To create the buttons and the display screen.
* **CSS:** To make it look like a real calculator with a dark theme and orange buttons.
* **JavaScript:** To make the buttons actually work! I used the `eval()` function to calculate the results.

While making this project, I learned:

* How to use `document.getElementById` to change text on a screen.
* How `CSS Grid` works to align buttons in rows and columns.
